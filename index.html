          Shy love, I think of you As the morning air brushes the window pane,
          And how much time of all it takes to know The movement of your arm,
          the steps you take, The curves along your head, your ears, your hair.
          For all of this, each hand, each finger, Each lip, each breath, each
          sigh, Each word and sound of voice or tongue, I would require an age
          to contemplate. But for your heart your mind your thoughts, all these,
          To love them all I need at least five centuries.
